# MoneyAssistant

This is an open-source android app, named "Money assistant", The app's core is about tracking the user's budget, showing
reports about his items and providing "wallets" for fragmenting money into different categories, This app is educational
for me to learn about android technologies like clean architecture, material design guidelines, Threading, SQLITE and many
other technologies that this platform provides, This is one of 4 upcoming projects that should sync together to provide 
a smarter experience for the user in his/her life.
